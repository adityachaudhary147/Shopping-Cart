## Setup on local machine

To set-up the development environment on your local machine, follow the below steps:

1. Fork the repository to your github account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    *Downloading python is mandatory for windows users. On macOS you may have python 2.x pre-installed, consider installing python 3.7 or higher. This step is generally not required for most linux users since most linux distros come with pre-installed python (typically 3.7 or higher).*

**Make sure you add python to your system path if it's not already added**

### Windows

- Open command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create a virtual environment (preferably the parent directory of the one in which the cloned project resides). 
- Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`. Here, `env` can be replaced by any name of your choice.
- Activate the virtual environment: `env\Scripts\activate.bat`.
- run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Navigate into the project directory where you have the `manage.py` file
- Now run the server: `python manage.py runserver`.
- Open a browser and go to: `https://localhost:8000/`. You should see a working django app showing that "the install worked successfully."

### Linux/macOS

- Open the terminal and follow the same steps as in the above **Windows** section with a few changes described below.
- Instead of using `python` in commands, use `python3`.
- To activate the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`.
- Other steps are same as in Windows.
